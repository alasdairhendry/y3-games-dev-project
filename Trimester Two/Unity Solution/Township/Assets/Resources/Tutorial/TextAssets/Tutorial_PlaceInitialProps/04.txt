Now your citizens have a Warehouse they can use.

The Town Plaque and Warehouse were built instantly to get you started.
From now on, your citizens will need to use resources from the Warehouse to build them for you.

Press {0} to open up the Resources Panel, or open it through the Town Data Menu. 
This will show you what resources are currently stored in the Warehouse.

Use these resources to build some houses for your citizens. {1} should be enough.
