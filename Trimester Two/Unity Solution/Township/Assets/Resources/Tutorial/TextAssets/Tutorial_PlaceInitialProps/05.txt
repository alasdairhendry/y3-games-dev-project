Placing a House has created some jobs for your citizens.

They will haul the resources required, Wood & Brick, from the Warehouse to the House, and then they will build it.

If you don't have enough resources, you can click on trees or rocks and order them to be removed. 
This will provide you with immediate resources, but the entity will be destroyed permanently.

You can view active, open and completed jobs by pressing {0} to open the Jobs Panel.
