Great.
Now your citizens know where they are from.

Next, we need a Warehouse.
Warehouses are used to store resources that your citizens gather, produce or trade.

You can have as many Warehouses as you wish, and having more means your citizens will have to walk less distance to store resources.

Open the Build Menu again and place a Warehouse this time.
