It looks like you've placed your first Marketplace.

The Marketplace is a passive building that allows travelling Merchants to trade with you.

Each day, Merchants travel all around Township looking for the best deals.

Having one Marketplace shows the world that you are open for trade. However, Merchants rarely travel to places that aren't worth their time.

Each Marketplace that is built increases your reputation as a Market Town. This will influence Merchants when they are deciding where to travel next.

You can toggle trading at any time by clicking on a Marketplace building.
