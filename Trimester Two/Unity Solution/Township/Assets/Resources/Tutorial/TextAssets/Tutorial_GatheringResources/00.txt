To get started, you'll want to gather a surplus of Wood.
Wood is the most basic, but most important, resource in Township.
It can be used to build new buildings and provide fire for your citizens.

To gather wood, you'll need to build a Lumberjack's Hut.

After it's built, select 2 citizens and change their profession to Lumberjack.
They will start working the Lumberjack's Hut.

Alternatively, you can press {0} to open the Professions Panel, and assign professions through there.
