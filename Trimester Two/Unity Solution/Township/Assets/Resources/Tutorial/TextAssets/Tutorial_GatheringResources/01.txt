Looks like you got ahead of yourself and built a Lumberjack's Hut all on your own!

Lumberjack Huts allow your citizens to gather Wood.

Wood is the most basic, but most important, resource in Township.
It can be used to build new buildings and provide fire for your citizens.

After a Lumberjack's Hut is built, select 2 citizens and change their profession to Lumberjack.
They will start working the Lumberjack's Hut.

Alternatively, you can press {0} to open the Professions Panel, and assign professions through there.
